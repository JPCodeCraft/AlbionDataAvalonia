An alternative client for [The Albion Online Data Project](https://www.albion-online-data.com/) that provides the same functionality as the official client, but with a user-friendly graphical interface and easy-to-use settings.
All the data is uploaded to The Albion Online Data Project! Albion Free Market does not host prices databases.

This software was developed by the [Albion Free Market](https://albionfreemarket.com/) developer, [JP codecraft](https://jpcodecraft.com/).

ATTENTION: this is a beta release. Use it at your own risk.

ATTENTION¬≤: if you use this client, uninstall the official AODP one. Otherwise you'll upload everything twice.

### Manual alternative

1. Download the `AFMDataClient_Linux64_Installer.sh` installer script from the [releases](https://github.com/JPCodeCraft/AlbionDataAvalonia/releases) section. This script will download the application, set the necessary capabilities, and configure it to launch at startup. The application file will be saved in the `~/AFMDataClient` directory.
2. To uninstall the application, download and run the `AFMDataClient_Linux64_Uninstaller.sh` script. This will reverse all changes made by the installer script.
3. Automatic updates are not currently available for Linux. To update the application, simply run the installer script again. This will download and install the latest version.
4. Before running the scripts you might need to do: `sed -i 's/\r$//'  AFMDataClient_Linux64_Uninstaller.sh` and `chmod +x AFMDataClient_Linux64_Installer.sh`.
